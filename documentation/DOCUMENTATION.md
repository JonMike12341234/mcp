## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Core Concepts

### Architecture Components

MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
- **Local Data Sources**: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
- **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

### Key Primitives

MCP defines three core primitives that servers can implement:

1. **Tools (User-controlled)**: Functions that can be invoked by the user or assistant
2. **Resources (Application-controlled)**: Context provided to the AI. Similar to GET endpoints in a REST API
3. **Prompts (User-controlled)**: Specific user-invoked interactions and pre-defined templates

## Benefits of MCP

MCP transforms the traditional "M×N problem" into an "M+N problem". Instead of building M×N different integrations between M AI applications and N tools/systems, you only need:
- N MCP servers (one for each system)
- M MCP clients (one for each AI application)

### Key Advantages

- **Standardization**: Single protocol for all AI integrations
- **Security**: Data stays within your infrastructure
- **Flexibility**: Switch between LLM providers and vendors
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Pre-built integrations available
- **Best Practices**: Built-in security and data handling practices

## Transport Mechanisms

MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms:

1. **Stdio servers**: Run as a subprocess of your application (running "locally")
2. **HTTP over SSE servers**: Run remotely, connect via URL (deprecated in favor of Streamable HTTP)
3. **Streamable HTTP servers**: Run remotely using the Streamable HTTP transport
